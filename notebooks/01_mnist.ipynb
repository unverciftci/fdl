        "MNIST is not only useful for its historical influence on Computer Vision, but it's also a great [benchmark](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~serailhydra/publications/tbd-iiswc18.pdf) and debugging tool. Having trouble getting a fancy new machine learning architecture working? Check it against MNIST. If it can't learn on this dataset, chances are it won't learn on more complicated images and datasets."
